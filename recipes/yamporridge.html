        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>When I say this is an insanely delicious vegetable yam porridge, you have got to trust me on this one. Now is it porridge or pottage? that I cannot answer?. I grew up calling dishes made this way porridge so I will like to stick to that. I have tried to find out the meaning of both to be able to differentiate, but I have got myself even more confused than ever. I decided to stick to what my childhood memories tell me, which is porridge. Feel free to call it pottage.</p>
